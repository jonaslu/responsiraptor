Demo site of the template can be found here: http://responsiraptor.blogspot.com/

## Short setup
Two changes are necessary to get it working - your diqus and google analytics (should you want these of course).

Search the template for $replace_with_disqus_short_name$ and $replace_with_GA_id$ - replace these strings with your respective data (including the both $ chars).

More background and info can be found on http://catchemecode.com/ (link to come)

## License
License is MIT - but in addition I'd would ask you to keep the "Responsiraptor theme by Jonas" footer text and link.

## Call me maybe
Don't be shy! I'd love to see how you applied it.
